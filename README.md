## TicTacToe-AI

This project let's u play tic-tac-toe against, a machine, yourlself, or a friend (locally).
The AI agent uses the [MinMax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). Also u can check out this video made by, [Sebastian Lague](https://github.com/SebLague) to understand it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&t

### Play

To play the game u gotta have java installed, and java must be in your path for the script to work, and u need to compile it on your machine, using the script,
´compile_src´.
Now that u have all installed, just run the script ´run_game´ and u can play the game.
    
A note, u can play the game in windows or mac, but u will have to compile and run your way, the script is only for linux.
